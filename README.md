# SteamOS Android Waydroid Installer

A collection of tools that is packaged into an easy to use script that is streamlined and tested to work with the Steam Deck running on SteamOS.
* The main program that does all the heavy lifting is [Waydroid - a container-based approach to boot a full Android system on a regular GNU/Linux system.](https://github.com/waydroid/waydroid)
* Waydroid Toolbox to easily toggle some configuration settings for Waydroid.
* [waydroid_script](https://github.com/casualsnek/waydroid_script) to easily add the libndk ARM translation layer and widevine.

**Script has gone through several updates - this now allows you to install Android 11 / Android 13 and their TV counterparts - Android 11 TV / Android 13 TV!**

# Install Steps
<details>
<summary><b>Click here - Read the sections below carefully for steps on how to install and use this script!</b></summary>

**Prerequisites for SteamOS**
1. `sudo` password should already be set by the end user. If `sudo` password is not yet set, the script will ask to set it up.

**How to Use and Install the Script**
1. Go into Desktop Mode and open a `konsole` terminal.
2. Clone the github repo.

   ```sh
   cd ~/
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/steamos-waydroid-installer
   ```

3. Execute the script! \

   ```sh
   cd ~/steamos-waydroid-installer
   chmod +x steamos-waydroid-installer.sh
   ./steamos-waydroid-installer.sh
   ```

4. Script will automatically install Waydroid together with the custom config. Install will roughly take around 5mins depending on the internet connection speed.
5. Once done exit the script and go back to Game Mode.

**Launching Waydroid**
1. Go to Game Mode.
2. Run the Android_Waydroid_Cage launcher.
</details>

# Additional Considerations
<details>
<summary><b>Click here - Read the sections below carefully. This are purely OPTIONAL.</b></summary>

**Steam Deck Controller Layout**
[Thanks to DanielLester83!](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer/issues/134)

Search 'Waydroid' in the community templates or maybe this link would work steam://controllerconfig/3665077347/3304296813

This maps the back buttons to function keys for use with android key remappers like this https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper

This work around seems to be needed because steaminput does not seem to pass the Search/OS/Windows/Meta Key to Android.

This layout also tweaks the trackpad inputs.

**Configure Android Start Menu Shortcuts to Work in Desktop Mode** \
NOTE: This is purely optional and doesn't affect the functionality of Waydroid if you don't do the steps.\
Personally I don't need it but for those that do then [this is what you need.](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer/issues/144) Thanks to DanielLester83 for the instructions!

**Controller Not Being Detected** \
The script has been updated so that the controller detection will get triggered once Android has completed the boot process. This makes the controller detection more accurate and the boot sequence to be faster.

However if you use Bluetooth headphones it will interfere with controller detection. Use the workaround mentioned [here](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer/issues/91#issuecomment-2497139748) and [here](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer/issues/91#issuecomment-2530544096)
</details>

# I dont want this anymore! I want to uninstall!
1. Go to Desktop Mode.
2. There will be an icon called Waydroid Toolbox on the desktop.
3. Launch that icon and select UNINSTALL.
![image](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer/assets/98122529/afdf9e95-7ccf-4bc8-9400-4b8332c5afe9)

# Troubleshooting / Filing Bug Reports
1. If you encounter an issue with the script, try to [uninstall](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer/tree/main#i-dont-want-this-anymore-i-want-to-uninstall), clone the repo again and perform an install.\
Reason for that - you might be using an older version of my script and a new version might have already fixed your issue.
2. If uninstall / reinstall didn't help, open an issue and please be descriptive as possible. \
At the minimum include this when filing an issue - \
SteamOS version - \
Error message encountered - \
Screenshot of error - \
Do you have any scripts / tweaks that might be causing issues?
3. Downloads are slow when acquiring the waydroid image. This is similar to this [issue](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer/issues/26). \
Answer - You might have connected to a slow sourceforge mirror. Press CTRL-C to cancel the download and re-run the script again.
4. No shortcuts in Game Mode after running the script / Unsupported File Type when adding shortcuts. This is similar to this [issue](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer/issues/25). \
Answer - This issue happens if Steam client cant be run because the script was called from an ssh or virtual tty session. Make sure to run the script on Desktop Mode via konsole.

# A Note on SteamOS Updates
When there is a SteamOS update the waydroid will be wiped. This is normal behavior due to how SteamOS applies updates. \
Re-run the script again but if the SteamOS update contains a new kernel version the script will exit immediately. \
Please file an issue report when this happens so I can compile a binder kernel module to match the SteamOS update.
